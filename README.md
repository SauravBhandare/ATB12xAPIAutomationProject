# ATB12x API Automation Programs

Welcome to the **ATB12x API Automation** repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning and implementation guide for automating REST APIs using **REST Assured**. It starts from the very basics and progresses through advanced topics, covering real-world API testing strategies, CRUD operations, integration with **TestNG**, and implementation of **data-driven testing** and **report generation**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the basics of REST APIs and HTTP methods.
- Learn and implement automation using REST Assured.
- Perform complete **CRUD** operations via automated tests.
- Integrate **TestNG** for structured and maintainable test execution.
- Generate professional test reports using **Allure Reporting**.
- Implement **data-driven testing** using **Apache POI/CSV** libraries.
